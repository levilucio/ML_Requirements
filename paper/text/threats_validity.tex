\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats_to_validity}

The validity of the study might be affected by the coverage of the search results, bias on study selection, and inaccuracy of data extraction.
\paragraph{Study Coverage.}
Some relevant studies could be missing in our study due to inadequate search strings or missing databases.
To cope with this threat, the data preparation was based on a systematic method.

\paragraph{Study Selection Bias.}
Study assessment might be biased by researchers.
To mitigate for this threat, a set of include and exclude criteria was predefined and researchers assessed the title and abstract of the papers based on them to steer the assessment.

\paragraph{Inaccuracy of Data Extraction.}
Also the data extraction process might be biased by researchers.
To mitigate for this threat, the selection of data items was strictly driven by the research questions.
Moreover, assignments were marked by the researchers depending on their confidence level. Low-confidence assignments were discussed between the authors until a consensus was reached.
