This is an introduction~\cite{Domingos:2015}

\textbf{RQ3}: What \ML task(s) is (are) used for which purpose in \RE?

\noindent
\textbf{RQ4}: Which model types are used to perform the \RE tasks?

Machine learning algorithms are shown to have considerable practical importance in many application domains. Especially in the domains where there are large databases and a need for identifying some consistencies or, domains where the program, needs to adapt itself to changes~\cite{Zhang2002}. Requirements engineering is a critical part of software engineering and it seems appropriate to use machine learning methods for requirements engineering tasks while the requirements specification documents are mainly in natural language and, ML can enhance the performance at some tasks by replicating human processing. \\
This paper aims to present a survey of how ML is benefiting the existing RE approaches. More precisely, we pursue the following research questions: \\
\noindent
\textbf{RQ1:} What is the current state of the practice in \ML${\&}$\RE?

\noindent
\textbf{RQ2:} What types of learning methods are there available at our disposal?

\noindent
\textbf{RQ3:} Which \RE problems can tackle with \ML methods?

\noindent
\textbf{RQ4:} Is using \ML methods improving the \RE process?

To achieve our goals we performed a literature review, which was split into data preparation, data collection, and data analysis phase. First, a search string was prepared based on the research questions, then a search was performed over a predefined set of databases and all identified studies were assessed by means of title and abstract. Our literature review is not an exhaustive study of the field rather we are offering a snapshot of the current state-of-the-art by borrowing some techniques from Systematic Literature Review.\\
The major contributions of this article are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We provide an overview of the current state of the art of the challenges \RE faces that may be handled through \ML techniques. Thereby we focus on two important aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Providing an overview of the \ML problem categories (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) in use for the support of \RE processes (elicitation, analysis, validation and, management).
        \item Providing an overview of the common \ML approaches (decision tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayesian, etc.) for tackling \RE problems and the data sets if available. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item We analyze the literature to discover trends and lessons on the use of \ML in \RE.
\end{itemize}
The paper is organized as follows. The rest of this section provides a background knowledge of \ML and \RE. Section \ref{sec:contributions} provides the overview of the issues that handled by \ML in different \RE process steps and, in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss the major study findings followed by a table for summarizing them. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:threats_to_validity} we state the possible issues that may affect the study validity.
