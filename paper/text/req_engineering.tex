\subsection{Requirements Engineering}

Software systems are developed over millions of lines of code, number of modules
and documents. The primary goal of the software system is to satisfy users by
developing the software that can meet their needs and expectations. This goal is
achievable by applying different methodologies and engineering techniques. One
of the key factor is to understand and identify the needs of users, also known
as, software requirements. Software requirement engineering is the process that
helps to determine the requirements in a systematic way to know what
functionalities the targeted system should have to fulfil user's needs. Formally
RE is defined as \cite{Zave:1997:CRE:267580.267581}:\\
\begin{quote}
``Requirements engineering is the branch of software engineering concerned with the real-world
goals for, functions of, and constraints on software systems. It is also concerned with the
relationship of these factors to precise specifications of software behavior, and to their evolution
over time and across software families."
\end{quote}
Software requirements play a key role in the success of a project. In the USA, a
survey was conducted over 8380 projects by 350 companies to know the project
failure rates. The report overall results showed only 16.2\% projects were
completed successfully and one-half (52.7\%) of projects met with challenges and
were completed with partial functionalities, time delays and over budget. Almost
31\% of the projects were never completed. The main cause told by the executive
managers was the poor requirement. The major problems were the lack of user
involvement (13\%), requirements incompleteness (12\%), changing requirements
(11\%), unrealistic expectations (6\%), and unclear objectives
(5\%).\cite{knuthwebsite} [6]\\
Software requirement engineering has mainly four phases; requirement
elicitation, requirement analysis, requirement documentation and requirement
verification \cite {Kotonya:1998:REP:552009}. Requirement elicitation
\cite{Coughlan:2002:ECR:2740304.2740444,Zowghi2005} helps to understand the
stakeholders needs, e.g. what features he wants in the software.
Requirement elicitation techniques are mostly derived by the social sciences,
organizational theory, knowledge engineering and practical experience. For
requirements elicitation, different techniques exist in the literature that
include interviews, questioners and ethnography etc.
Requirement analysis \cite{Nuseibeh:2000:RER:336512.336523} is the next step
after requirement elicitation. In this phase, software requirements are analyzed
to check conflicts and consistency of requirements. It is also makes sure that
the requirements are clear, complete and consistent. Furthermore, the agreed
requirements are documented. This documentation has a clear and precise
definition of the system functionalities. It also acts as an agreement between
stakeholders and developers. These functionalities and requirements are
documented usually as diagrams, mathematically formulae or natural languages.
These documents are used and iterated until the end of the projects.
System requirements are classified into businees requirments, user requirments,
functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR). Functional
requirements are the system requirements that include the main features and
characteristics of the desired system. Non-functional requirements are the
system properties and constraints \cite{Davis:1993:SRO:113586}. NFRs set the
criteria for judging the operation of the system e.g.
performance, availability and reliability etc.\levi{what about the business and
user requirements. Do we consider them?}
