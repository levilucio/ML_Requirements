\levi{summarize preprocessing steps and feature calculation}
\levi{disclaimer: sometimes features are presented sometimes not}
\levi{?} Stakeholders needs
(features)\levi{features in this case are just words} are initially preprocessed
by removing common (stop) terms, and computation of tf-id \levi{explain tfâ€“idf,
maybe extract it to a common section, in general explain that features are
words and the instances are tweets/reviews/\ldots} for each term.

Hollis \etal \cite{Hollis2017} proposed an initial study to automate requirement
elicitation in Agile environment by providing the list of words and loosely
formatted list of requirements. The proposed methodology applied text mining
technique on recorded conversation of the stakeholder and developer
conversation. It was a short paper and did not provide details.\\

Dong \etal \cite{dong2010} also applied text mining on different form of
document and resources from internet for gathering requirement. The system
applied data preprocessing as word segmentation and stop words removal and build
up the VSM model. Kaiya \etal \cite{Kaiya:2010} proposed a tool to improve the
domain knowledge ontology for requirement elicitation by using web mining and
NLP technique. It helped to mine the general concepts to ontology for
requirements elicitation.
