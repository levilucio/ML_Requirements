\subsubsection{Visualization}

Natural language requirement documents can be hard to comprehend and analyze. Similarly, stakeholders have to review and understand requirements for large and complex systems.  In these scenarios, basic information visualizations, like charts and graphs have been used in requirements engineering. These visualizations are usually applied to improve textual requirements with summarization that combined large amounts of information into a single representation for quick consumption by stakeholders\cite{Reddivari:2012}. Machine learning is of great value in discovering visualized groups of large numbers of requirements artifacts.\\

ReCVisu (Requirements Clustering Visualization) tool is presented in Reddivari \etal~\cite{Reddivari:2012} paper. ReCVisu, an exploration tool based on quantitative visualizations helps requirements engineers understand the nature of the requirements in a visual form. In ReCVisu, the dependence graph consists of requirements artifacts as nodes and the textual similarities as edges. The automatic grouping of requirements into clusters can help in areas such as uncovering the requirements structure, navigating around the requirements space, modularizing crosscutting concerns, and understanding requirements interactions and evolution.\newline

Pinqui \etal~\cite{Pinqui:2015} recognize the enormous volume of requirements as big data with which companies struggle to make strategic decisions early on. Therefore, they built a complete visual framework to filter requirements from stakeholders in a way that architects can make better insightful decisions. They suggest training a multi-class SVM model from domain-specific (mechanics, electronics, etc.) dictionaries and handbooks. Overall, the paper proposes a framework to go from management-oriented requirements to architecture-oriented requirements in which SVM is only applied in a small part of it. \newline

Software requirements are mostly stated in natural text notations such as user stories which is making it hard for people to develop an accurate mental image of the most relevant entities and relationships. Lucassen \etal~\cite{Lucassen:2016} introduced an automated method for visualizing requirements at different levels of granularity. Their visualization method from user stories consists of 1) the generation of an overview which provides a general context for understanding the dataset: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Extract a set of relevant concepts from the user stories and their relationships 
\item Calculate the semantic similarity by using skip-gram implementation word2vec
\item Utilize Wardâ€™s clustering algorithm to group all the concepts according to their similarity 
\item Identify the concept which is most similar to the collection of concepts in a cluster
\item Generate inter-cluster relationships matrix
\item Visualization Drawing
\end{itemize}
2) zooming in and out mechanisms and 3) filtering techniques to reduce the complexity of the data presentation. Possible anticipated applications of this visualization are: discovering missing relationships between clusters that may result in further user stories, teaching system functionality by exploring simplified, manageable chunks, and analyzing expected system changes after introducing new sets of user stories.
