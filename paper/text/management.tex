\subsubsection{Visualization}

Natural language requirement documents can be hard to comprehend and analyze. Similarly, stakeholders have to review and understand requirements for large and complex systems.  In these scenarios, basic information visualizations, like charts and graphs have been used in requirements engineering. These visualizations are usually applied to improve textual requirements with summarization that combined large amounts of information into a single representation for quick consumption by stakeholders\cite{Reddivari:2012}. Machine learning is of great value in discovering visualized groups of large numbers of requirements artifacts.\\
