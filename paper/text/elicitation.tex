\subsection{Requirements Elicitation and Discovery}

The manual process of requirement elicitation is time-consuming and required
efforts, and sources. The project success majorly depends upon the precise
identification of stakeholder expectations and requirements for their desired
system. Poor elicitation can lead to over budget and time issues. Requirements
elicitation can be done by mining the available dataset e.g., social media,
documents, and gathering and analyzing information available on the internet,
publically or privately available data. In short, gathering data from different
means and analyze them for requirements elicitation.  The latest trend for
identification of user requirement is mining social media like twitter, google
store, and app store data. These user reviews are not structured requirement and
contained other information too such as praise, dislikes, bug report etc.  The
unstructured, extra information and noise presence in the above-described
sources makes the manual process difficult and challenging. The automated
analysis of requirement elicitation is helpful and can significantly reduce
time, effort, and cost. This is ML classification task: give the set of
information and identifying it as a requirement or not.

\subsubsection{Internal vs External}
Guzman \etal \cite{Guzman:2017} proposed ALERTme approach for classifying,
grouping and ranking tweets in software evolution process. For identification of
evolutionary requirement supervised classification performed on tweets as
improvement request or not using Naïve Bayes algorithm. It was the first kind of
this study that finds user requirements from tweets for software. Williams \etal
 \cite{Williams:2017} performed a similar study on
tweets for classifying as user requirement or not. The study gave state of the
art results using Naïve Bayes and VSM\levi{introduce VSM?} algorithm. Different
techniques were implemented for feature extraction that includes stopword removing, sentimental
analysis, stemming\levi{bring to machine learning section}, and Bag of words.
For learning process maually annotated tweets were used. However, results showed
that software tweets are neutral in nature and sentiment analysis did not
influence ML algorithm.\\

Research on mining user reviews in mobile application (app) stores has
remarkably advanced in the past few years. Jiang \etal \cite{Jiang:2014}
presented an optimized method for discovering the evolutionary requirements for
developers. This method clustered opinion expressions in form of a macro network
topology, and combine polarized sentimental analysis with the economic factors
to decide evolutionary requirements. The dataset used POS tagger and parser with
additional defined rules for feature extraction. Douglas S. ~etal
\cite{Douglas:S2008} mapped software requirement elicitation process to an
existing military tool skiweb that used for making the decision. The proposed
methodology used supervised Naive Bayes to classify text document to find
related requirements. Furthermore, recommendation system used topic modeling to
identify the key stakeholder for which that requirement is important and allow
for the analysis. Jha \etal \cite{Jha:2017} Classified application store reviews
and discover user requirement as feature request. The data was classified into
three categories bugs, features, and junk. For classification, SVM and Naïve
Bayes algorithm was used. The study used frame semantic analysis that genralize
more abstract contexts. This technique produced slower dimensional model with
smaller number of features, that help to enhance the prediction
capabilities.Herrera\etal \cite{Castro-Herrera:2009} proposed a tool to scale up
the support for large-scale systems requirements processes in comparison to
traditional requirements elicitation process. The large oftware systems are
complex due to this it is hard to manage stakeholders and identify the relevant
stakeholders for further discussions.
The proposed recommender framework used feature requests of different projects
in form of natural language statements.
An unsupervised clustering techniques used to identify cohesive themes out of
these features. Then tool constructed user profiles according to the interests
of the stakeholders in each of these themes for recommender system. Stakeholders
needs (features) are initially preprocessed by removing common (stop) terms, and
computation of tf-id for each term. \\



\subsubsection{Text mining} 
 Herrera \etal \cite{Castro-Herrera:2009} provide semi-automatically manage broad stakeholder participation in the requirements elicitation and prioritization process. 
The proposed system analyzed datset i.e. gathered from stakeholders and automatically generated highly specialized topical forums i.e. themes identification, and assign it to stakeholders accordingly.
On these forums stakeholder can work collaboratively to transform statements of need into sets of articulated and prioritized requirements. For themes identification unsupervised clustering
techniques applied to massive amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. The dataset was  small collection of featur requests created by 36 graduate level students for an Amazon-like student web-portal system. Hollis \etal \cite{Hollis2017} proposed an initial study to automate requirement elicitation in Agile environment by providing the list of
words and loosely formatted list of requirements. The proposed methodology
applied text mining technique on recorded conversation of the stakeholder and
developer conversation. Dong ~etal \cite{dong2010} also applied text mining on
different form of document and resources from internet for gathering
requirement. The system applied data preprocessing as word segmentation and stop
words removal and build up the VSM model. Kaiya \etal \cite {Kaiya:2010} proposed a
tool to improve the domain knowledge ontology for requirement elicitation by using web mining and NLP
technique.It helped to mine the general
concepts to ontology for requirements elicitation.
