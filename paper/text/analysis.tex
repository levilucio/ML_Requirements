\subsection{Functional and Non functional Requirements}

The success of system solely not depends on functional requirements. Just as functional requirements, it also significantly depends upon the adherence to non-functional requirements. In general, the primary focus is more for identification and specification of the FR.  NFRs usually identified and specified in the late development process that can increase the risks. FRs tend to be more straightforward e.g. store and retrieve transaction. On the other side, NFRs are complicated and challenging to implement e.g., making the design to meet NFRs or design test case for them. Different types of requirements analyzed in different way and it is useful to have separate division to look at one particular class. That is why it is necessary to distinguish between FR and NFR and categorize NFRs into subcategories. This distinction help to manage changes in requirements. The manual distribution is difficult and time consuming. Machine learning can be used for reducing the effort and categorizing the requirements based on the text segment analysis. This is ML classification task: give the set of requirements and identifying its category. \\

\etal~\cite{} Automatically classify the user review text into FR, NFR and others. It further classify the NFR into four categories as reliability, usability, portability, and performance. It used supervised machine learning algorithm (bagging) for training the classifier. The text was trimmed by stop words elimination, lemmatization, stemming, and sentences split. For augmenting the user review word2vec used. Word2Vec is actually a two layer neural network to process text for finding the word embedding. \etal~\cite {Deocadez:2017} performed semi-supervised classification techniques for automated classification of FR and NFR in user reviews from the app store. This study deals with two problems: 1) minimize annotate or label the big dataset of user reviews 2) classification of FR and NFR. First problem solved by using semi-supervised self-labeling algorithm. Self-labelling algorithms needs only small amount of dataset to get the comparable results with supervised techniques. For classification problem Na√Øve Bayes algorithm used. Features are obtained by applying standard text mining technique and additional attribute embellishment. For text mining technique following features used:  Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Transform, Term Frequency (TF) Transform, Lowercase transformation, Minimum term frequency, Stemmer, Number of words. The second stage involved removing numbers, 2- letter words and other symbolic characters.\etal~\cite{ Kurtanovic:2017}performed automated analysis of number of software requirements and performed classification on FR, NFR and its different categories using supervised machine learning algorithm(support vector machine). Additional dataset of user comments from Amazon used to overcome the data imbalance problem in NFR. For feature extraction text preprocessing techniques used such as removal of punctuations, removal of stop words, and lemmatization. 


\subsubsection{Security Requirements} 

Due to the orthogonal character of their impact on a system, \emph{security}
requirements are notoriously difficult to identify, objectify and
quantify~\cite{}. Also during requirement specification, it very often
happens that security requirements are masked by functional requirements
(but can be deduced from the context of the domain the system operates
in)~\cite{Riaz:2014}. Because of this, it often happens in practice that
security requirements are only marginally tackled during system
construction~\cite{}, paving the way to potentially catastrophic consequences.
Machine learning can be of use here by aiding in the identification of segments
of text that describe security requirements. This is a \emph{classification}
problem: given a text, identify which parts of it correspond to which
type of security issues.\\

Jindal\etal~\cite{Jildal:2016} automatically learn decision trees that can be
used to classify security requirements as \emph{authentication}, \emph{access
control}, \emph{encryption} or \emph{data integrity}. The \emph{features} used
are relevant terms found in the text. Such relevant terms are obtained by the
following sequence of actions: 1) removing stop words from the text; 2) stemming
the remaining words; and 3) ranking the stemmed words by their \emph{info-gain}
measure.
