abstract="Requirement Analysis (RA) is a relevant application for Semantic Technologies focused on the extraction and exploitation of knowledge derived from technical documents. Language processing technologies are useful for the automatic extraction of concepts as well as norms (e.g. constraints on the use of devices) that play a key role in knowledge acquisition and design processes. A distributional method to train a kernel-based learning algorithm is here proposed, as a cost-effective approach for the validation stage in RA of Complex Systems, i.e. Naval Combat Systems. The targeted application of Requirement Identification and Information Extraction techniques is here discussed in the realm of robust search processes that allows to suitably locate software functionalities within large collections of requirements written in natural language.",
