A distributional method to train a kernel-based learning algorithm is here proposed, as a cost-effective approach for the validation stage in RA of Complex Systems, i.e. Naval Combat Systems. The targeted application of Requirement Identification and Information Extraction techniques is here discussed in the realm of robust search processes that allows to suitably locate software functionalities within large collections of requirements written in natural language.",

abstract="Online reviews that manifest user feedback have become an available resource for eliciting requirements to design future releases. However, due to complex and diverse opinion expressions, it is challenging to utilize automated analysis for deriving constructive feedback from these reviews. What's more, determining important changes in requirements based on user feedback is also challenging. To address these two problems, this paper proposes a systematic approach for transforming online reviews to evolutionary requirements. According to the characteristics of reviews, we first adapt opinion mining techniques to automatically extract opinion expressions about common software features. To provide meaningful feedback, we then present an optimized method of clustering opinion expressions in terms of a macro network topology. Based on this feedback, we finally combine user satisfaction analysis with the inherent economic attributes associated with the software's revenue to determine evolutionary requirements. Experimental results show that our approach achieves good performance for obtaining constructive feedback even with large amounts of review data, and furthermore discovers the evolutionary requirements that tend to be ignored by developers from a technology perspective.",

publisher="Springer International Publishing",
address="Cham",
pages="273--287",
abstract="Context and motivation: Research on mining user reviews in mobile application (app) stores has noticeably advanced in the past few years. The majority of the proposed techniques rely on classifying the textual description of user reviews into different categories of technically informative user requirements and uninformative feedback. Question/Problem: Relying on the textual attributes of reviews often produces high dimensional models. This increases the complexity of the classifier and can lead to overfitting problems. Principal ideas/results: We propose a novel semantic approach for app review classification. The proposed approach is based on the notion of semantic role labeling, or characterizing the lexical meaning of text in terms of semantic frames. Semantic frames help to generalize from text (individual words) to more abstract scenarios (contexts). This reduces the dimensionality of the data and enhances the predictive capabilities of the classifier. Three datasets of user reviews are used to conduct our experimental analysis. Results show that semantic frames can be used to generate lower dimensional and more accurate models in comparison to text classification methods. Contribution: A novel semantic approach for extracting user requirements from app reviews. The proposed approach enables a more efficient classification process and reduces the chance of overfitting.",

We consider the tremendous volume of requirements as big data with which companies struggle to make strategic decisions early on. This paper proposes a collaborative requirement mining framework to enable the decision-makers of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements so as to make early effective strategic decisions. The framework supports OEMs willing to uncover a subset of key requirements by distilling large unstructured and semi-structured specifications.",

pages="39--54",
abstract="Context and motivation: Requirements of todays industry specifications need to be categorized for multiple reasons, including analysis of certain requirement types (like non-functional requirements) and identification of dependencies among requirements.This is a pre-requisite for effective communication and prioritization of requirements in industry-size specifications. Question/problem: Because of the size and complexity of these specifications, categorization tasks must be specifically supported in order to minimize manual efforts and to ensure a high classification accuracy. Approaches that make use of (supervised) automatic classification algorithms have to deal with the problem to provide enough training data with excellent quality. Principal ideas/results: In this paper, we discuss the requirements engineering team and their requirements management tool as a socio-technical system that allows consistent classification of requirements with a focus on organizational learning. We compare a manual, a semi-automatic, and a fully-automatic approach for the classification of requirements in this environment. We evaluate performance of these approaches by measuring effort and accuracy of automatic classification recommendations and combined performance of user and tool, and capturing the opinion of the expert-participants in a questionnaire. Our results show that a semiautomatic approach is most promising, as it offers the best ratio of quality and effort and the best learning performance. Contribution: Our contribution is the definition of a socio-technical system for requirements classification and its evaluation in an industrial setting at Mercedes-Benz with a team of ten practitioners.",

It is generally understood that requirements are elicited rather than just captured or collected. This implies there are discovery, emergence, and development elements in the elicitation process. Requirements elicitation is a complex process involving many activities with a variety of available techniques, approaches, and tools for performing them. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these determine when each is appropriate depending on the context and situation. The objectives of this chapter are to present a comprehensive survey of important aspects of the techniques, approaches, and tools for requirements elicitation, and examine the current issues, trends, and challenges faced by researchers and practitioners in this field.",

abstract="Context {\&} motivation: More and more software projects today are security-related in one way or the other. Many environments are initially not considered security-related and no security experts are assigned. Requirements engineers often fail to recognise indicators for security problems. Question/problem: Ignoring security issues early in a project is a major source of recurring security problems in practice. Identifying security-relevant requirements is labour-intensive and error-prone. Security may be neglected in order to finish on time and in budget. Principal ideas/results: In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a tool-supported method that provides assistance for requirements engineering, with an emphasis on security requirements. We investigate whether security-relevant requirements can be automatically identified using a Bayesian classifier. Our results indicate that this is feasible, in particular if the classifier is trained with domain specific data and documents from previous projects. Contribution: We show how the ability to identify security-relevant requirements can be integrated in a workflow of requirements analysis and reuse of experience. In practice, this can increase security awareness within the software development process. We discuss limitations and potential of this approach.",

abstract="This paper describes a technique for automating the detection and classification of non-functional requirements related to properties such as security, performance, and usability. Early detection of non-functional requirements enables them to be incorporated into the initial architectural design instead of being refactored in at a later date. The approach is used to detect and classify stakeholders' quality concerns across requirements specifications containing scattered and non-categorized requirements, and also across freeform documents such as meeting minutes, interview notes, and memos. This paper first describes the classification algorithm and then evaluates its effectiveness through reporting a series of experiments based on 30 requirements specifications developed as term projects by MS students at DePaul University. A new and iterative approach is then introduced for training or retraining a classifier to detect and classify non-functional requirements (NFR) in datasets dissimilar to the initial training sets. This approach is evaluated against a large free-form requirements document obtained from Siemens Logistics and Automotive Organization. Although to the NFR classifier is unable to detect all of the NFRs, it is useful for supporting an analyst in the error-prone task of manually discovering NFRs, and furthermore can be used to quickly analyse large and complex documents in order to search for NFRs.",

abstract="[Context {\&} motivation] Obtaining traceability among requirements and between requirements and other artifacts is an extremely important activity in practice, an interesting area for theoretical study, and a major hurdle in common industrial experience. Substantial effort is spent on establishing and updating such links in any large project -- even more so when requirements refer to a product family. [Question/problem] While most research is concerned with ways to reduce the effort needed to establish and maintain traceability links, a different question can also be asked: how is it possible to harness the vast amount of implicit (and tacit) knowledge embedded in already-established links? Is there something to be learned about a specific problem or domain, or about the humans who establish traces, by studying such traces?",

We consider the tremendous volume of requirements as big data with which companies struggle to make strategic decisions early on. This paper proposes a collaborative requirement mining framework to enable the decision-makers of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to gain insight and discover opportunities in a massive set of requirements so as to make early effective strategic decisions. The framework supports OEMs willing to uncover a subset of key requirements by distilling large unstructured and semi-structured specifications.",
